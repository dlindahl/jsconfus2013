			<div class='title'>BPM Detection with JavaScript</div>
			<p>Digital Signals Processing (DSP) is inherently essential to any signals-based field, be it digital audio effects, computer graphics, or computer vision.  The web has just begun it's foray into accommodating for DSP, becoming increasingly equipped to handle and modulate signals with the advent of technologies such as the Web Audio API and WebGL.  With the basic DSP tools provided by these technologies, we are minimally bootstrapped and able to leverage these tools to implement powerful algorithms and incorporate powerful fields of research.  One such application is the modulation and processing of music signals.  In this talk I will focus on an application that is more complicated than it seems: automatic BPM detection of music.  Due to the complexities of how we as humans perceive sound,  parse harmonics, and "feel" beats within a song, BPM becomes a challenging and enthralling problem to tackle.  I've just begun to embark on an endeavor to implement BPM detection in javascript, building upon budding DSP tools in JS and pulling from algorithms hardened by academic research.  I have been digging into academic research papers in the field identifying and categorizing plausible algorithms from simple to complex, separated by effectiveness for differing applications.  I hope to implement a number of these algorithms across this spectrum and compare their effectiveness for different kinds of music and applications.  I believe exposing and providing robust algorithms for BPM detection would be a strong tool and asset towards many javascript-based web (and server-side ;D) applications, whether for categorization purposes, or for something more dynamic like music visualization.</p>
			<p>I first began my investigation into BPM detection as a way to break music visualization out of its frequency rut to reflect more compelling metrics such as BPM &amp; key, which encode our consumption and perception of music in a different way.  I plan to use my implementations to build out music visualizations that use alternative metrics in a compelling way that reflects (or invokes!) how we emotionally react to the music we listen to.</p>

			<div class='title'>Meet Janessa</div>
			<p>When Janessa was in elementary school, she wanted more than anything to make a website about Pokémon. Upon typing “HTML” in Alta Vista’s search box, a journey began from which she never turned back. Bolstered by a plethora of diverse influences—14 years of classical piano, a Bioengineering degree from Duke, and a Master’s in Computer Science from Columbia—she has developed a passion for finding ways to breed engineering research, music, and art with the trusty steed of JavaScript to make the magical unicorns of her imagination a reality. By day she hacks for Twitter in New York as a member of the Web team.</p>

			<div class='title'>JavaScript is Literature is JavaScript</div>
<p>Anyone who thinks Brendan Eich invented JavaScript has probably never read Oscar Wilde. “The truth is rarely pure and never simple” says Algernon in Wilde's Importance of Being Earnest, thus betraying a wary familairity with our favorite language. It turns out JavaScript's highly expressive nature and the infinite posibilities of its syntax made it a favored medium for our literary forebears.</p>
<p>Last summer I introduced the concept of Literary JavaScript with <a href="http://byfat.xxx/if-hemingway-wrote-javascript">If Hemingway wrote JavaScript</a>, wherein five famous writers demonstrated their JavaScript smarts. That article generated very positive reactions from both the JavaScript and Literary communities (including write-ups in the New Yorker, Huffington Post and Wired Magazine) and this talk will build on those themes, drawing parallels between the myriad stylistic facets of JavaScript and the kaleidescope of literary genres. There is a serious aspect - I hope to demonstrate that JavaScript's loose structure and lack of boilerplate encourages creativity and is something to celebrate rather than something to WTF about.</p>
<p>Oh, and as an added bonus I'll be unveiling an additional set of recently re-discovered works of literary JavaScript genius.</p>

			<div class='title'>JavaScript Masterclass: How you you go from being a good developer, to a great one?</div>
			<blockquote>
			<p>I am not an expert developer. I am also not a beginning developer. </p>
			<p>I'm an intermediate developer, and I want to navigate the path from being a mediocre or good developer, to becoming a great or expert level developer. </p>
			<p>How in the heck do I do this?</p>
			<p>The tutorial ecosystem of the web is heavily skewed towards beginners, but what about the rest of us?</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>If you identify with these statements in the slightest, then this talk is for you. With ideas from cognitive science, education, and some advice from admired programmers along the way, we are going to explore what it means to be a world-class developer and what we need to do to get there. I'll talk a little bit about the philosophy, attitude, and habits (both good and bad) required for learning how to learn better, and then we will talk about the kinds of skills and knowledge that an expert programmer in general needs. Along the way we'll touch about various myths and cognitive biases about who can and cannot be a great programmer, and leave you with a path to get started. By the end of the talk, I will have proposed a curriculum of topics that should take an intermediate developer and turn them into an advanced one, and special attention will be given to mastery of the JavaScript language.</p>

			<div class='title'>Meet Rebecca</div>
			<p>I'm a JavaScript developer at <a href="http://bocoup.com">Bocoup</a> and a frequent speaker on the topic of code organization and best practices at various conferences, including JSConf US 2011, JSConf EU 2010, Full Frontal UK 2012, Fronteers (Amsterdam) 2012, and many others. I'm a co-organizer of the <a href="http://2012.texasjavascript.com/">TXJS conference</a>, the author of the learning site <a href="http://jqfundamentals.com">jQuery Fundamentals</a>, a contributor to the jQuery Cookbook from O'Reilly Media, and a technical reviewer for David Herman's Effective JavaScript. I'm also the co-host of the long-lost but occasionally resurrected yayQuery podcast. Most importantly, though, the bacon at the <a href="http://2009.jsconf.us">first JSConf</a>? I helped make that happen.</p>
